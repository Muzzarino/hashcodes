<p><strong>By: guyc 14/Sep/11 15:32:54 </strong></p><p>Prevented Speech group from getting stopped when LEVEL_COMPLETE event is triggered in single player. This will allow the mission fail speech to play in spec ops. The game now triggers the RESTART and QUIT events so speech is stopped when selecting these options. This will prevent in-game speech (e.g. barks) from playing once QUIT has been selected (because to quit, it has to return briefly to the game in the background). However, this will stop the "mission failed" speech (but you'd expect this to stop if you select 'quit' anyway).</p>
