<p><strong>By: steved 18/Sep/12 11:16:58 </strong></p><p>A number of slow mo's have been scattered about some cutscenes, which causes the Sfx tracks to go out of sync. (Eg. Odd Job Boss fight). All CS sfx to tracks now have game slow mo tracking set in case these continue to be added. Hopefully the music triggering will still sound OK - obviously slow mo's change the durations of the scenes, which will make any dramtic hit points in the score go out.</p>
<p><strong>By: steved 17/Sep/12 14:23:45 </strong></p><p>Fix for 11918 - Slow Mo has been added to CS_B12_LTK_087_SmashDoor_Main, which made sounds go out of sync. This is now fixed.</p>
<p><strong>By: steved 17/Sep/12 10:19:11 </strong></p><p>Noticed 6 pieces of music were incorrectly set to "LOW" Codec type, as opposed to "Music". FIXED.</p>

<p><strong>By: guyc 07/Sep/12 21:09:17 </strong></p><p>Widened the npc generic tails.</p>
<p><strong>By: guyc 07/Sep/12 21:09:04 </strong></p><p>Set more npc loop key-offs to sync to beat (and double checked tempos)</p>
<p><strong>By: guyc 07/Sep/12 20:43:50 </strong></p><p>Re-timed the "drive away" scene at the end of Ice Hotel.</p>
<p><strong>By: guyc 07/Sep/12 20:10:09 </strong></p><p>Muted the Aston's Decel sound - as the way it is set up, it cannot track the full rev range.</p>
<p><strong>By: guyc 07/Sep/12 20:05:41 </strong></p><p>Added a small amount of predelay to generic npc tails in an effort to reduce overall channel count. And the magic number is: 48ms.</p>

<p><strong>By: duncanb 07/Sep/12 11:48:07 </strong></p><p>SFX for console download no Icarus MP mode - placed in culling group with the capture control point SFX to kill the loop.<br></p>
<p><strong>By: guyc 07/Sep/12 11:29:07 </strong></p><p>Boosted Draco's heli-assault lines. Removed the radio process from "James, get on the minigun" as you can see him when he says it.</p>
<p><strong>By: guyc 06/Sep/12 21:41:47 </strong></p><p>Added slight delays to the start of certain multiplayer barks to clean things up.<br>Game-descriptions and game win/lose/draws are delayed by around half a second. As are phone pickups and "control point capture" lines.</p>

<p><strong>By: guyc 06/Sep/12 19:30:34 </strong></p><p>Shortened all npc loop-end wavs to 0.5 sec (except moonraker laser) in an effort to clean up the sound channel usage. As this is a release element in the npc weapon loop, it is allowed to play to its natural end, so needs to be either shortened, or set as a separate sfx with aggressive culling, or both.</p>
<p><strong>By: duncanb 06/Sep/12 17:47:58 </strong></p><p>Fireworks loop for DAD IceHotel opening scene</p>
<p><strong>By: guyc 06/Sep/12 17:36:25 </strong></p><p>Reduced global max count per npc weapon to 5 from 6. Could probably go lower. This value affects single player more than multi - as the single player campaign has less weapons per level, and therefore more guns of the same type going off at once. The hopefully fixes any dropouts on console disc builds.</p>
<p><strong>By: duncanb 06/Sep/12 16:37:29 </strong></p><p>New female sniper breaths.</p>
<p><strong>By: guyc 06/Sep/12 15:14:39 </strong></p><p>Slightly more aggressive culling of npc generic weapon tails.<br><br>Tighter radii on soldier footsteps. Should help Fort Knox.</p>

<p><strong>By: guyc 06/Sep/12 14:07:19 </strong></p><p>Taken lower-mid frequencies out of parts of the Alert sting to even it up a bit.</p>
<p><strong>By: guyc 06/Sep/12 13:04:29 </strong></p><p>Added a gun loop for the humvees on LTK driving cutscene.</p>

<p><strong>By: steved 25/Aug/12 11:33:27 </strong></p><p>Tanners Stealth Infographic on Auric - rejigged this stuff because of localisation overlap issues. - Locs have recorded different lengths for these, and since the English is so tightly triggered, it ends up overlapping. First line is now Instant Start. I have time compressed / trimmed the Locs to match english. Added Precahe event to each line in the controlling to ensure predictable timing since as they were, they would be prone to seek errors, which would contribute to the shoddy timing.</p>
<p><strong>By: steved 25/Aug/12 10:23:06 </strong></p><p>And reduced the vol of the trouser rub dramatically for normal run - it sounded like he's in a cheap tracksuit.</p>

<p><strong>By: steved 25/Aug/12 08:34:05 </strong></p><p>Created SPEECH_RADIO_SAFE ducker group for Pam radio instruction in LTK driving. This is not ducked by Frag Grenade sound. Infact, it puts a bit of duck on the Default no Duck Group. This is because Pam often sounded like the stream was being culled, but it was just ducking. Is ok for this, becuase not First person.</p>
<p><strong>By: steved 25/Aug/12 07:50:06 </strong></p><p>Humvee Engine sounds were in DEFAULT_NO_DUCK group, but this drowned out Pam chattering to you on radio. Have created a new group called VEHICLES_ENIGNE, where Radio Speech dicks the engine a bit. You could use this group for Bike engine if needed. Not noticed it to be a problem on Ice Drive.<br><br>Also, last part of boss fight CS, has slow down, so have put the CS_SFX stream in CS True Slowmo Mixgroup.</p>

<p><strong>By: guyc 24/May/12 10:23:03 </strong></p><p>Player weapon loop ending sound is now a standalone sfx triggered on each shot. A morph picks the indoor/outdoor sample via a sample-and-hold controller. This fixes the tiny glitches inbetween the loop and the ending that otherwise occur. It also provides us with the ability to resample and edit the different ending sounds.<br><br>This means that the predelay times within these sounds will have to match the length of one shot for that weapon. The idea is that the sound is fired off an each shot, but the sound is delayed by the duration of a shot with a culling setting of 1/steal.<br></p>
